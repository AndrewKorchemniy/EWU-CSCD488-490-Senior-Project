# EWU CSCD488/490 Senior Project: Status Reports

> This project is similar to the reporting system used in CSCD 350 and 488/490 to define and track project requirements, as well as individual and team performance. The old system still works fine, but it is out of date in many respects. Weâ€™d like a new standalone version (not integrated with anything else).
