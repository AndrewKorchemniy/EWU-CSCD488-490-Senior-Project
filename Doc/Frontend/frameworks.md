# Frameworks & Dependencies

The following is a brief overview of the frontend frameworks and dependencies used.

## Bootstrap

_If you're not using a CSS framework, you're probably doing it wrong._  
The frontend is using the latest version of Bootstrap (5.3) for styling and functionality.  
Within the [code documentation](https://www.tftinker.tech/EWU-CSCD488-490-Senior-Project/Doc/code/), the purpose and use of any Bootstrap components are noted.  
Bootstrap [utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/utilities/) are also used throughout the frontend.  
See the [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) for more information.

All custom styles that cannot be achieved within Bootstrap are defined in `src/assets/main.css`.

## Yew

The frontend is written in [Yew](https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/introduction), a Rust framework for building web apps.  
Yew is a component based framework, similar to React, Vue, and Angular.  
There are two types of components in Yew: functional components and struct components.  
The frontend uses functional components, which are defined as functions that return a `Html` type using the `html!` macro.  
You will find many examples online using both. However, functional components are the preferred method of writing components in Yew.
